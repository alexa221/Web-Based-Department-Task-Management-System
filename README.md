# Task_Management 
The aim of the Department Level Task Management project is to help users keep track of their tasks, mark their completion status, and manage them efficiently. It provides an interactive platform where users can add, update, or delete tasks. The application will have a user authentication system to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks securely.

### 1. Frontend (React JS):
- The frontend of the application will be created using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application will have components, such as a task form for adding new tasks, task list for displaying tasks, and task item for each individual task.
- The frontend will also use state management libraries like Redux for easier management of global states. It will also feature client-side routing with React-Router to ensure smooth navigation between different pages of the application.

### 2. Backend (Express JS):
- The server-side of the application will be built using Express JS, a minimalist web framework for Node.js that is used for creating APIs and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- The backend will handle user authentication using sessions or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication between the client and server.
- The server will provide endpoints for managing tasks, such as adding, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as retrieving the list of tasks.

### 3. Database (MySQL):
- MySQL, a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), will store user information and tasks.
- The database schema will be designed to store data about users, their tasks, and the completion status of each task.

### 4. ORM (Sequelize):
- Sequelize, a promise-based ORM for Node.js, will be used to handle database operations.
- Sequelize helps simplify the process of working with databases, providing an easy-to-use API for performing CRUD operations and managing database schema and migrations.
- By using Sequelize, we can abstract database operations and interact with the MySQL database using JavaScript instead of SQL queries.
